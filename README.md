16. IAM User Setup
Create an IAM user with the necessary permissions for EKS, S3, DynamoDB, ECR, and EC2.

# Steps to begin:
1. On AWS Console, search I am, and click Users.
 aws console

Next, click Create User
 click create user
Give a username to your iam User.

 IAM user name
Attach administrative access for testing; for your company project, assign limited policies, and click Create user.
 
Now you can create an access key
Click Security Credentials, and click on create access key.

 access key
Click Command Line Interface (CLI)
 
Download the file for later use of the secret key and access key.

We have done now with IAM user creation.
2. Terraform & AWS CLI Installation
To install Terraform, You can visit Terraform official website.
To install AWS CLI, You can Visit AWS installtion page.

After installation, you can verify installation with these two commands
terraform --version
aws --version        
Then configure aws CLI using the given blow commands, Use Access and secret key from the CSV file you download in the IAM User step.
aws configure        

 
3. S3 Bucket and DynamoDB Table
As S3 Bucket and Dynamo DB are required for Terraform's backend state, you can create them by watching my video.
S3 bucket can be any, give any unique name to it.
lock-files name will be DynamoDB table, and the partition key will be LockID.

 
4. Jenkins EC2 Server Setup with Terraform

Clone the git repo.
git clone https://github.com/codewithmuh/three-tier-devsecops-project.git        
Go to the folder jenkins-server-terraform in the terminal.
Just make sure to make changes in backend.tf file. Update the name of the s3 bucket and dynamo db name.
Next, we have to run the command to create .pem file for our Jenkins instance. will be used to ssh the server.

 aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name devsecops-project --query "KeyMaterial" --output text > devsecops-project.pem        
Now run this command to create a Jenkins server.
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform apply        
Now ssh to your server :
Make sure you run these commands from the folder where your pem file exist.
chmod 400 "devsecops-project.pem"

ssh -i "devsecops-project.pem" ubuntu@35.92.246.29        
configure aws on the Jenkins server(EC2 Instance). As you did for your local machine.
aws configure        
5. Installing Plugins on Jenkins
Open the EC2-IP:8080 in the browser.
You can get the password of Jenkins
 sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword        
Install recommended plugins.
After creating Jenkins accounts, go to manage Jenkins -> plugins -> available plugins
We have to install all these mentioned plugins.
* AWS Credentials
* AWS Steps
* Docker plugins
* Eclipse Temurin installer
* NodeJS
* OWASP Dependency-Check,
* SonarQube Scanner.

1. SonarQube Setup:
Open Sonarrqube in the browser.
http://<jenkins-server-public-ip>:9000
username and password for sonarqube is admin.

Next, We have to perform 5 Steps on the sonarqube setup.
1.	Setup of frontend project for code analysis
2.	Setup of backend project for code analysis
3.	Replace the keys in jenkins-pipeline folder, you got from the above two steps. (watch video sonarqube setup)
4.	create a sonar-token, and save it somewhere for later use in Jenkins.
5.	create a webhook on the sonarqube dashboard. (http://<jenkins-ec2-server-public-ip>:8080/sonarqube-webhook/)

7a. Add Cred. in Jenkins

Got to Manage Jenkins -> Credentials.
We have to add here a total of 7 Credentials.

* aws-key
* GITHUB (username & Password)
* github (secret text)
* sonar-token
* ECR_REPO_FRONTEND
* ECR_REPO_BACKEND
* ACCOUNT_ID (aws account id)

 ![preview](./images/image30.png)


Now We have to configure the installed plugins. (important)
In Tools, We have to configure JDK, sonar-scanner, nodejs, DP-Check, and docker.
Go to Dashboard -> Manage Jenkins -> System
Search for SonarQube installations
Provide the name as it is, then in the Server URL copy the sonarqube public IP (same as Jenkins) with port 9000 select the sonar token that we have added recently, and click on Apply & Save.

1. EKS Cluster Deployment
We have to create EKS Cluster using the below commands.
 eksctl create cluster --name three-tier-k8s-eks-cluster --region us-west-2 --node-type t2.medium --nodes-min 2 --nodes-max 2        
Once the cluster is ready, you can validate if the nodes are ready or not.
kubectl get nodes        
Now, we will configure the Load Balancer on our EKS because our application will have an ingress controller.
Download the policy for the LoadBalancer prerequisite.
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.5.4/docs/install/iam_policy.json        
Create the IAM policy using the below command

![preview](./images/image37.png)

aws iam create-policy --policy-name AWSLoadBalancerControllerIAMPolicy --policy-document file://iam_policy.json        
Create OIDC Provider

![preview](./images/image49.png)

eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --region=us-west-2 --cluster=three-tier-k8s-eks-cluster --approve        
Create a Service Account by using below command and replace your account ID with your one
eksctl create iamserviceaccount --cluster=three-tier-k8s-eks-cluster --namespace=kube-system --name=aws-load-balancer-controller --role-name AmazonEKSLoadBalancerControllerRole --attach-policy-arn=arn:aws:iam::<your-account-id>:policy/AWSLoadBalancerControllerIAMPolicy --approve --region=us-west-2        
Run the below command to deploy the AWS Load Balancer Controller
helm repo add eks https://aws.github.io/eks-charts
helm repo update eks
helm install aws-load-balancer-controller eks/aws-load-balancer-controller -n kube-system --set clusterName=three-tier-k8s-eks-cluster --set serviceAccount.create=false --set serviceAccount.name=aws-load-balancer-controller        
After 2-3 minutes, run the command below to check whether your pods are running or not.
kubectl get deployment -n kube-system aws-load-balancer-controller

9. Prometheus and Grafana Installation and Configuration
What is Grafana?
Grafana is an open-source platform for visualization and analytics. It allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and explore metrics from various data sources.
Steps to Install and Configure Prometheus and Grafana on Kubernetes
Step 1: Add Helm Repositories
1.	Add Helm Stable Chart Repository
helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable        
2. Add Prometheus Community Helm Repository
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts        
Step 2: Create a Namespace for monitoring
kubectl create namespace monitoring        
Step 3: Install Prometheus with Grafana using Helm
Install the kube-prometheus-stack chart, which includes both Prometheus and Grafana:
helm install stable prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack -n monitoring        
This command deploys Prometheus and Grafana as part of the kube-prometheus-stack in the prometheus namespace on your EC2 instance.
Step 4: Verify Prometheus Installation
Check the Prometheus pods:
kubectl get pods -n monitoring        
Check the Prometheus services:
kubectl get svc -n monitoring        
Since Grafana is deployed along with Prometheus, there is no need for separate Grafana installation.
Step 5: Expose Prometheus and Grafana to External Access
There are two ways to expose these services:
1.	NodePort
2.	LoadBalancer

![preview](./images/image54.png)
![preview](./images/image55.png)
![preview](./images/image56.png)
![preview](./images/image57.png)
![preview](./images/image58.png)
![preview](./images/image59.png)

Exposing Prometheus via LoadBalancer:
kubectl edit svc stable-kube-prometheus-sta-prometheus -n monitoring        
Save the file. The service should now have a load balancer with an external IP to access Prometheus.
Exposing Grafana via LoadBalancer:
Similarly, edit the Grafana service configuration to change ClusterIP to LoadBalancer:
kubectl edit svc stable-grafana -n monitoring        
Save the changes and use the load balancer IP in your browser to access Grafana.
Step 6: Accessing Grafana
The username will be admin and the password will be prom-operator for your Grafana LogIn.

step of the Grafana dashboard with Prometheus as explained in the video.

9. Jenkins Pipelines (Frontend & Backend)
This step do not include any commands, you can watch it in my video.

10. ArgoCD Installation & Application Deployment
kubectl create namespace three-tier        
kubectl create secret generic ecr-registry-secret \
  --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=${HOME}/.docker/config.json \
  --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson --namespace three-tier
kubectl get secrets -n three-tier        

Now, we will install argoCD.
To do that, create a separate namespace for it and apply the argocd configuration for installation.

![preview](./images/image66.png)
![preview](./images/image67.png)
![preview](./images/image68.png)
![preview](./images/image69.png)

kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.4.7/manifests/install.yaml        
All pods must be running, to validate run the below command
kubectl get pods -n argocd        
Now, expose the argoCD server as LoadBalancer using the below command
kubectl patch svc argocd-server -n argocd -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'        

You can validate whether the Load Balancer is created o by going to the AWS Console load balancers.
To access the argoCD, copy the LoadBalancer DNS CNAME record and hit on your favorite browser.
Now, we need to get the password for our argoCD server to perform the deployment.
To do that, we have a pre-requisite which is jq. Install it by the command below.
sudo apt install jq -y        
export ARGOCD_SERVER=$(kubectl get svc argocd-server -n argocd -o json | jq -r '.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname') && export ARGO_PWD=$(kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d) && echo "ARGOCD_SERVER: $ARGOCD_SERVER" && echo "ARGO_PWD: $ARGO_PWD"        
Next will deploy our Three-Tier Application using ArgoCD
As our repository is private. So, we need to configure the Private Repository in ArgoCD.
Then We have to set up applications.
1. database
2. backend
3. frontend
4. frontend-ingress
5. backend-ingress

6.  DNS Configuration
This step do not include any commands, you can watch it in my video.
1.  Conclusion
We have set up a Persistent Volume and a Persistent Volume Claim. This means that if the pods are deleted, the data will not be lost, as it will be stored on the host machine.

Extra: Clean up Everything. If you did this project for testing. To avoid costs on AWS.

First, you must delete your EKS Cluster, Run this command on your Jenkins server.
eksctl delete cluster --name three-tier-k8s-eks-cluster --region us-west-2 --wait --timeout 30m        
Note: If you encounter any errors related to the load balancer, you will need to delete the frontend and backend load balancers first, then delete your cluster. You can use ChatGPT to learn how to delete your load balancer.
 
When the cluster is deleted successfully.
Then On the Local machine, destroy the infrastructure in your terminal at folder jenkins-server-terraform
terraform destroy        
Finally, you can delete your S3 bucket, DynamoDB, and your IAM user.
